# CyclicCA-MatrixPortal
Arduino implementation of 2D cyclic cellular automata algorithm on HUB75 display with Adafruit Matrix Portal

2D cyclic cellular automata as described in https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~gravner/papers/cca.pdf

Description of the algorithm and collections of presets available at http://www.mirekw.com/ca/rullex_cycl.html and https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/cyclic-cellular-automata/

Currently supports Neumann neighborhoods only. Written for 32x32 led matrix, support for other sizes to be added later.
